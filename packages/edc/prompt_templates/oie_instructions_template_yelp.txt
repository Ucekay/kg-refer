Here are some examples:

Important guidelines:
- Strictly only include the triples in your answer
- Do not include any explanation or apologies
- Business entities must use their id; all other entities must use their name
- Focus on extracting factual relationships from the text.
- Prefer short entities over long ones when both refer to the same concept.
- To enhance graph connectivity, also infer and add broader, general categories. These general categories must be directly linked to the head entity, rather than creating multi-hop connections through specific item entities.
