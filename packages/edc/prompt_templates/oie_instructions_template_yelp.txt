Your task is to transform the given text into a semantic graph in the form of a list of triples. The triples must be in the form of [Entity1, Relationship, Entity2].

Here are some examples:

Important guidelines:
- Use the most semantically accurate Relationship (predicate) to connect Entity1 and Entity2. You are not limited to the relationships used in the provided examples.
- Strictly only include the triples in your answer
- Do not include any explanation or apologies
- Business entities must use their id; all other entities must use their name
- Focus on extracting factual relationships from the text, and infer general relationships when appropriate.

**CORE RULES:**

1. **ENTITY1 (HEAD) MUST BE THE ITEM ID:**
   - Entity1 (the subject/head of each triple) MUST ALWAYS be the Item ID (business/venue that appears in the text)
   - DO NOT use "User", "Customer", "Guest", "Visitor", "Shopper", "Diner", or any user-related entities as Entity1
   - Extract what the item IS, HAS, OFFERS, SERVES, or PROVIDES - NOT what users do or prefer
   - Example: Use ["92", "serves", "Thai food"], NOT ["User", "likes", "Thai food"]

2. **UNIQUE TAIL ENTITIES:**
   - Each tail entity (Entity2) can appear ONLY ONCE per item
   - If the same entity needs different relationships, choose the most meaningful one

3. **ALWAYS ADD GENERAL CATEGORIES:**
   - For every specific item, ALSO extract its base category
   - "extensive beer selection" → extract BOTH "extensive beer selection" AND "beer"
   - "delicious food" → extract BOTH "delicious food" AND "food"
   - "spicy curries" → extract BOTH "spicy curries" AND "curry"
   - "unique twists on classic dishes" → extract BOTH the phrase AND "dishes"
   - These are different strings, so no uniqueness violation

4. **KEEP GENERAL CATEGORIES SIMPLE:**
   - Use base nouns: "beer", "food", "dishes", "curry"
   - Use singular when possible: "dish" or common plural "dishes"
   - This helps different items connect in the graph
