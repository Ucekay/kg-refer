Your task is to transform the given text into a semantic graph in the form of a list of triples. The triples must be in the form of [Entity1, Relationship, Entity2].

Here are some examples:
{few_shot_examples}

Important guidelines:
- Use the most semantically accurate Relationship (predicate) to connect Entity1 and Entity2. You are not limited to the relationships used in the provided examples.
- Strictly only include the triples in your answer
- Do not include any explanation or apologies
- Business entities must use their id; all other entities must use their name
- Focus on extracting factual relationships from the text.
- Avoid Redundancy: Keep tail entities (Entity2) concise. If the Relationship already implies the category, the tail entity should be simplified
- Prefer short entities over long ones when both refer to the same concept.
- **GENERAL CATEGORY INFERENCE:**
    - **Always infer and add broader, general categories for specific items mentioned.**
    - For example: **"spicy curries"** requires the general category **"Curry"**. **"raw oysters"** requires **"oysters"**. **"craft beer"** requires **"Beer"**.
    - These general categories must be directly linked to the head entity (e.g., [ID, Relationship, General Category]).
    - Do not create multi-hop connections.
